# About the project

In this project we are making a scrollytelling that has an socially impactful theme. 
This project goes through a story about how Global Warming are affecting the different seasons. 

This project is useful for developing our skills further as Web Devolopers. A scrollytelling is also a good way to tell a story. 

The project starts at the top, and the users will then scroll down to see the story evolve. 
If the users needs help, they can easily click on the "questionmark"-button that will be added to the website. There it will cointain useful information about how to use the website.

In this website, technologies such as HTML, CSS/SASS and JavaScript is used to develop the scrollytelling website. 

The group of this prosjekt, Lisa, Alexandra and Fadumo, are all responsible to contribute and maintaiing the project.
